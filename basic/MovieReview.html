      <b> Arjun <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nani_(actor)">(Nani)</a></b>is a 36 year old, ex-Ranji best batsman
      whose career fails to
      take off. But what happens when he decides to make it to the <b>Indian
      cricket</b> team despite his age?

    <h1>Review</h1>
    <p style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%; text-align:justify; font-size: 22px; font-family:arial;">
      It’s the season of sports films in southern cinema and the success of
      recent films such as Kanaa, Natpe Thunai and Majili is proof to the
      popularity of the genre. If done right, sports dramas can be both moving
      and inspiring and there can’t be a better example than Nani starrer
      <font color="brown"><b>Jersey</b></font>, which is <u>truly a rewarding story of triumph and self-discovery.</u>
      Even though it comes across as a familiar story of dreams and failure set
      against a sports backdrop, it goes beyond exploring the usual tropes that
      are generally associated with such films.<br />
      To call Jersey just the story of an ex-cricketer Arjun <i>(Nani)</i> <mark>who fights
      conventions to get selected in the Indian cricket team is a grave
      injustice to the film, even if that’s how it sums itself up.</mark> It is also
      the story of the love of his life Sarah <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shraddha_Srinath">(Shraddha
        Srinath)</a>, who struggles
      to stay in love with the man he has become. It’s the story of assistant
      coach Murthy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sathyaraj">(Sathyaraj)</a> who sticks by an orphan through thick
      and thin,
      even at his most irrational best, in hope that he will be able to aid him
      in achieving his dream someday. But, most importantly, <b> it’s the story of a
        father who’s so enamoured with his son Nani <i>(Ronit Kamra)</i> that he would do
        anything to not stoop low in his eyes and get him the birthday gift he
        always wanted.</b>

    <h1>Drawbacks</h1>
    <ul style="font-size: 20px; margin-right: 5%; font-family:arial;">
      <li>
        The length of the film is a tad long and there is a chance for the film
        to be trimmed for at least 8 to 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        The second half of the film is also good but becomes a bit predictable
        when the cricket is showcased. Routine cricket scenes bring the pace
        down a bit.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="font-size: 20px; margin-right: 5%; font-family:arial;">
      <b>Finally...</b><br />Jersey is a film which has some of the best
      performances in recent times. <font color="purple">Every character in the film is so well
      enacted that you get carried away with all the emotions throughout the
      film.</font>
